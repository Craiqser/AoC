/*
All parts begin in the workflow named `in`.
{x=787,m=2655,a=1222,s=2876}: in -> qqz -> qs -> lnx -> A
{x=1679,m=44,a=2067,s=496}: in -> px -> rfg -> gd -> R
{x=2036,m=264,a=79,s=2244}: in -> qqz -> hdj -> pv -> A
{x=2461,m=1339,a=466,s=291}: in -> px -> qkq -> crn -> R
{x=2127,m=1623,a=2188,s=1013}: in -> px -> rfg -> A

Ultimately, three parts are accepted. Adding up the x, m, a, and s rating for each of the accepted parts gives 7540 for the part with x=787, 4623 for the part with x=2036, and 6951 for the part with x=2127. Adding all of the ratings for all of the accepted parts gives the sum total of 19114.
